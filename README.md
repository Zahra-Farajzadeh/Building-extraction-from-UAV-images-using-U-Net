# Building-extraction-from-UAV-images-using-U-Net
This notebook extracts binary BUILDING in Tensorflow-Keras farmework. We will use a custom dataset from Yazd province of Iran. This task will classify pixel of input image as BUILDING or NON-BUILDING.
# PACKAGES

### Rasterio
To write and read GeoTIFF and other formats
to organize and store gridded raster datasets such as satellite imagery and terrain models.

# Numpy
Used for working with arrays
Various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), shape manipulation, sorting, selecting
It has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices

# Matplotlib
Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib works like MATLAB
creates a figure,
creates a plotting area in a figure
plots some lines in a plotting area
plot with labels
Plot charts with Legend

# Cv2
Used for image processing and performing computer vision tasks.
Face detection
Objection tracking

# Glob
Returns an array of filenames or directories matching a specified pattern

# Random
A function for generating random samples

# Scikit-learn
Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis

# Tensorflow
open-source library for fast numerical computing
created by Google for the Python programming language
An end-to-end machine learning platform
best practices for data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, and model retraining

# Keras
High-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks
Written in Python
Supports multiple backend neural network computation. Exp:Tensorflow                    
Easy to learn and work and slow
Beginner-friendly

# Tensorflow vs Keras:
TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple machine-learning tasks
Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow. Both provide high-level APIs used for quickly building and training models Keras is more user-friendly
